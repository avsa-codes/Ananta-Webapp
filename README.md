# Ananta Platform

Ananta is a modern commerce platform focused on connecting users with authentic products, artisans, NGOs, and cultural initiatives through a clean, scalable, and story-driven digital experience.

The platform is being built as a **full-scale product**, not a demo or experimental project.  
The frontend experience is largely complete, and the backend is being actively developed and expanded.

> Ananta is designed to be a long-term, scalable platform combining commerce, culture, and impact.
